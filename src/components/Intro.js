          <h2>My Skills</h2> <ul> <li><strong>Front-End Development</strong>: Expertise in HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and frameworks like React and Angular.</li> <li><strong>Back-End Development</strong>: Proficient in Node.js, Express, and databases such as MongoDB and MySQL.</li> <li><strong>Responsive Design</strong>: Focused on creating seamless experiences across all devices and screen sizes.</li> <li><strong>Version Control</strong>: Skilled in using Git and GitHub for collaborative and efficient code management.</li> </ul>
          <h2>My Journey</h2> <p> My journey into web development started in a place you might not expect – student affairs in higher education. While I found supporting students quite rewarding, I realized that my personal growth lied elsewhere and I found myself increasingly drawn to the world of technology specifically web development.

Determined to make a change, I began teaching myself the basics of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The more I learned, the more fascinated I became with the ability to create interactive and visually appealing websites from scratch. This newfound passion led me to enroll in an intensive coding bootcamp, where I immersed myself in front-end and back-end development.
Today, as a web developer, I bring a unique perspective to the table. My experience in student affairs has instilled in me a deep understanding of user needs and a commitment to creating accessible and intuitive digital experiences.
